# Ideation

## Early Concepts

*Friday, October 10th 2025*

Here are the game ideas I came up with during the first big brainstorm. Some are more appropriate than others in terms of project feasability (scale, complexity, etc.) Much like choosing a blogging platform, simplicity can be an enabling constraint. I figure I can think big and then find the right manageable nuggets to work with.

Shortly before this brainstorm, I attended a workshop at the 2025 Queerness in Games Conference where Meghan Blythe Adams ran an ideation session for making games about non-monogamies. When I arrived, my intention was to work on an idea that popped into my head after listening to Avery Alder's keynote (see: Idea 1). I realized pretty quickly that I would have years to develop my own ideas and only this unique opportunity to listen and observe as a room full of people shared their thinking about non-monogamies in/and games and tried to make something together. Abandoning the need to have attention paid to my own idea turned out to be a really valuable learning experience. For 95% of the workshop, I (non-monogamously) moved between tables, asked what each group was working on, and listened to their concepts for a design. I did participate in the conversation and offer input where it was welcome, but prioritized making space for others and reflecting on what happened at each table.

**Idea 1. Playing with love languages**  
The workshop provided attendees with an option prompt to make a game about "compersion," or, the experience of feeling joy or pleasure in response to seeing or knowing one's partner has a romantic or sexual connection with someone else. The game I imagined involved three players in a hinge relationship (two people being in a relationship same person but not each other) communicating with one another using "secret" languages. After some reflection, I realized that what I'd come up with wasn't really about compersion, but about positive relationships between metamours. It's still an idea for a game about non-monogamy, so here goes nothing. How could a game explore the pleasure and joy of seeing metamours share positive interactions through improvisation and collaboration?  

For this game, players would get into groups of three and decide who is the hinge partner. The hinge spends time with each partner (in private) to develop a "secret language." This language could be anything but the written word, including play with objects, sounds, images, body work, humming, whistling, tapping, facial expressions, etc. When not creating a language with the hinge, the partners spend time either practicing their language (if they go first) or coming up with ideas for their language (if they go second). Everyone comes back together and the two arms of the hinge attempt to communicate with each other using their respective languages. This process could be repeated so that each player gets the chance to be the hinge. 

Thoughts:
-This game like this centres around pleasures and anxieties of the body
-Players could benefit from something concrete to guide the conversation. Maybe they could be provided with prompts, etc. to help guide the conversation? Maybe the group generates some keywords they try to communicate to each other and the goal is to guess and translate?
-The asymmetrical experience of being on one's own and playing with others at various stages could be used to represent how we inevitably find ourselves on the outside of certain dynamics, waiting for our partners to come back to us. What kinds of feelings come up while waiting for your turn, or while watching the two arms of the hinge play together?  

**Idea 2. Playing with competition**  
What might happen if I attempt to design a game about non-monogamies by taking a familiar gaming experience and adding a relational twist? In this case, I can imagine three different versions of a game where the connective thread between them is competition.  

Version 1: Polypoly
This game would do away with the competitive aspects of Monopoly, making the collection of resources and transformation of the board into a collective, shared experience where everyone loses or wins as a group. How could I re-align Monopoly with a queer politics of non-monogamy (anti-competitive, not instrumentalizing relationships, supporting non-nuclear family structures, etc.)? Each space could lean into actual lived non-monogamous relationships. For example, if someone lands on a space where they need to pay that month’s rent, there could be an option to move in with a partner, or for the wider network to help with bills. Similar mechanics could exist for non-monogamous co-parenting, etc.  

Version 2: Bad Polyamory
For this game, I would want to take a familiar, intentionally competitive game and add a non-monogamous twist, inviting a group of players (this could be an actual polycule or not) to lean into the tension and chaos of competition despite being in a relationship dynamic known for its anti-competitiveness (e.g., polyamory). In this case, the fun of the game is leaning into "bad" polyamory, working against each other and engaging in sabotage rather than collectively coming together to make the dynamic work. During the workshop, one group attempted something along these lines with Monopoly, but I think there are other games that could be a good fit for this project.  

Example A: The "longest road" achievement in Settlers of Catan could be turned into a game where the goal is to build the biggest polycule.  

Example B: I could play with the idea of "Pokémon polyamory" (collecting partners sans queer relationship ethics) through a summoning-and-battling style game in RPG Maker.  

Example C: The Game of Life would is a competitive game about moving up the relationship escalator and hitting expected life milestones as you grow your nuclear family. This could be interesting to tinker with. I am imagining the player moving around the board in little car that gets bigger every time a new person becomes part of your polycule/community; the car would eventually get comedically large and no longer fit on the board (going outside the bounds of "normal" relationships).  

Version 3: Queer competition
A third game in this series could involve engaging with competition in ways that DO align with a queer politics of non-monogamy. How could the rules and structure of competition be changed to make this happen? I have already been exploring how tandem play generates opportunities for queer forms of competition, so maybe there’s a metagaming idea in here somewhere: What happens if we get a group of players to tandem play a single player game of their choice, collectively determine the rules and their goals, and then compete in ways that are actually supporting queer ways of desire and relating that are relevant to each person?  

**Idea 3: Playing with parts and wholes**  
What would it look like to make a game about seperate parts coming together to form a unified whole? I'm thinking of media like *Voltron* or *Pacific Rim* where multiple people make up a larger being that needs an alignment of desires, boundaries, and decisions in order to maintain their form and progress through the game. The point would not be to eliminate the differences between characters, but to make choices that help them stick together in spite of those differences.  

I am imagining a *Pacific Rim*-style mech where all the players inside need to find a state of relative equilibruim (or to meet each other in more chaotic states) in order to pilot it effectively. Like a Katamari that rolls itself. I think it would be important that not being aligned doesn't result in a fail state and is instead treated as a new set of conditions that can be adapted to as the players work through conflict. This could represent how being out of alignment is part of all relationsups and is something to work through rather than succeed at avoiding forever. This would also be an interesting way to experiment with alt controllers.

**Idea 4: Playing with parallels and mirrored states**  
What would it mean to make a game where movement and positioning are key, but are complicated by the connections between players. Here, I’m thinking about those classic*Zelda* puzzles where you activate a statue that copies or mirrors your movement to solve a puzzle. I would want for a game like this to explore the way that the decisions we make in relationships ripple out to effect other; sometimes we can plan for those effects, and other times they catch us by surprise. What if making a move on one side of the board effected our partners in other parts of the board? Mixing up types of movement could be interesting: Instructions to “move three spaces forward” would be very different from instructions like “move to the nearest tile with a tree on it” for different players on the board.  

For reference, here's a link to [the Sacred Grove Guardian puzzle from *The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SERx6pByLE).  

**Idea 5: Playing with phantoms and load-sharing**  
I was thinking about FromSoftware (Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Elden Ring) and how their online multiplayer system works following a presentation at QGCon. These games are notorious for being difficult and unwelcoming to players. Progress requires us to learn and adapt to each enemy's movements and attacks, often through a trial and error process (where you die a lot). Something that can be really encouraging in these unforgiving worlds is how other players going through this process can show up in your game as ghosts and leave you helpful messages. Walk up to a bloodstain on the ground, and you can see the phantoms and the words they've left behind. If you come across these ghosts and their weird puddles outside a particularly difficult area or a boss fight, they can offer vague hints, words of encouragement, and even silly attempts at sabotage that (although unhelpful for winning) can ease the stress and make you feel less alone. What could it look like to make a game that represents non-monogamy through a distribution of the difficulty of being in the game world across a network?  

I'm imagining a game about pulling off a heist in an outer space setting. In an ideal situation, the whole team can work together on the problem the whole time, but life doesn't work that way: between scheduling differences, different kinds of connections with each other, different goals and desires, and the inevitability of conflict, there are times when the whole team can't be there at the same time, or even times when you find yourself alone. Maybe in these situations, helpful phantoms emerge as members of the team shift between timelines/universes that are layered on top of each other. Some kind of connection that tells the player their network is here to support them, even when they can't all be there physically at once. Maybe despite a physical absence, they can give the player guidance, information, items, levity, etc. that helps them navigate the challenge of solving the problem, even when going "solo."  

The problem could have a variety of solutions depending on who on the team is present/absent at various points of the journey. Maybe your team was scattered across these strange temporal-spatial layers during some world-bending cosmic event and the technology you’re using to bring them into your layer/sustain their existence in “the real world” can only do so for so long/in certain combinations/during specific windows of opportunity. 

**Idea 6: Playing with vessels and waters**
I'm thinking about sailing/the sailboat as a metaphor for the relational network (see: *Spiritfarer*). What would it look like to make a game where you start on the militaristic “boat” and then move toward the more equitable and responsive sailing ship?

The warship/ (militaristic, top-down control, clearly defined roles, inflexibility, movement “upward” through merit, insulated from the elements through technological means, set on a determied warpath)

 vs 

The sailboat (distributed power, shifting roles, flexibility, everyone does a little of everything and jumps in when needed, exposed to the elements and using technology to respond to them, navigating open water – response-ability (see: Alexis Shotwell, Donna Haraway))

## Refining Early Concepts (Continued...)  

*Saturday, October 11th, 2025*  
  
During our last meeting, we decided to move forward with the idea of playing with competition. Since this idea entails creating non-monogamy related variations on familiar competitive, this option makes the most sense in terms of project feasibility.  

Since then, I've spent some time creating [an ideation board on Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKRo1kSM=/?share_link_id=854742179856) to show my thinking behind the decision to work with this game or that. 

On this board, I started by sketching out the research context and coming up with a couple questions to frame my thinking:
- Q1: What can using MDM to make an intentionally non-monogamous game tell us about the potential for non-monogamies to catalyze/realize opportunities for queer(er) design and play? 
- Q2: What can we learn about designing for queer(er) play by taking a familiar game system/structure that was designed for a normative mode of play (traditional competition) and re-working it to include non-monogamy? 

I originally narrowed my game selection down to a non-digital option, *The Game of Life*, and a digital option, *Pac-Man*. While working with a classic arcade game would probably be simpler than let's say, *Settlers of Catan*, I think *The Game of Life* is the meatiest option to work with, especially given the way the game has evolved over time. I've used the Miro board as a space to map out the different elements that make up *The Game of Life*, as well as the (significant) differences between the 1860s and 1960s versions.
