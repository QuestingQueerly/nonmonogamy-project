# Journal: Desigining Non-Monogamies in Games

## Ideation and Early Concepts

*Friday, October 10th 2025*

Here are the game ideas I came up with during the first big brainstorm. Some are more appropriate than others in terms of project feasability (scale, complexity, etc.) Much like choosing a blogging platform, simplicity can be an enabling constraint. I figure I can think big and then find the right manageable nuggets to work with.

Shortly before this brainstorm, I attended a workshop at the 2025 Queerness in Games Conference where Meghan Blythe Adams ran an ideation session for making games about non-monogamies. When I arrived, my intention was to work on an idea that popped into my head after listening to Avery Alder's keynote (see: Idea 1). I realized pretty quickly that I would have years to develop my own ideas and only this unique opportunity to listen and observe as a room full of people shared their thinking about non-monogamies in/and games and tried to make something together. Abandoning the need to have attention paid to my own idea turned out to be a really valuable learning experience. For 95% of the workshop, I (non-monogamously) moved between tables, asked what each group was working on, and listened to their concepts for a design. I did participate in the conversation and offer input where it was welcome, but prioritized making space for others and reflecting on what happened at each table.

**Idea 1. Playing With Love Languages**  
The workshop provided attendees with an option prompt to make a game about "compersion," or, the experience of feeling joy or pleasure in response to seeing or knowing one's partner has a romantic or sexual connection with someone else. The game I imagined involved three players in a hinge relationship (two people being in a relationship same person but not each other) communicating with one another using "secret" languages. After some reflection, I realized that what I'd come up with wasn't really about compersion, but about positive relationships between metamours. It's still an idea for a game about non-monogamy, so here goes nothing. How could a game explore the pleasure and joy of seeing metamours share positive interactions through improvisation and collaboration?  

For this game, players would get into groups of three and decide who is the hinge partner. The hinge spends time with each partner (in private) to develop a "secret language." This language could be anything but the written word, including play with objects, sounds, images, body work, humming, whistling, tapping, facial expressions, etc. When not creating a language with the hinge, the partners spend time either practicing their language (if they go first) or coming up with ideas for their language (if they go second). Everyone comes back together and the two arms of the hinge attempt to communicate with each other using their respective languages. This process could be repeated so that each player gets the chance to be the hinge. 

Thoughts:
-This game like this centres around pleasures and anxieties of the body
-Players could benefit from something concrete to guide the conversation. Maybe they could be provided with prompts, etc. to help guide the conversation? Maybe the group generates some keywords they try to communicate to each other and the goal is to guess and translate?
-The asymmetrical experience of being on one's own and playing with others at various stages could be used to represent how we inevitably find ourselves on the outside of certain dynamics, waiting for our partners to come back to us. What kinds of feelings come up while waiting for your turn, or while watching the two arms of the hinge play together?  

**Idea 2. Playing With Competition**  
What might happen if I attempt to design a game about non-monogamies by taking a familiar gaming experience and adding a relational twist? In this case, I can imagine three different versions of a game where the connective thread between them is competition.  

Version 1: Polypoly
This game would do away with the competitive aspects of Monopoly, making the collection of resources and transformation of the board into a collective, shared experience where everyone loses or wins as a group. How could I re-align Monopoly with a queer politics of non-monogamy (anti-competitive, not instrumentalizing relationships, supporting non-nuclear family structures, etc.)? Each space could lean into actual lived non-monogamous relationships. For example, if someone lands on a space where they need to pay that month’s rent, there could be an option to move in with a partner, or for the wider network to help with bills. Similar mechanics could exist for non-monogamous co-parenting, etc.  

Version 2: Bad Polyamory
For this game, I would want to take a familiar, intentionally competitive game and add a non-monogamous twist, inviting a group of players (this could be an actual polycule or not) to lean into the tension and chaos of competition despite being in a relationship dynamic known for its anti-competitiveness (e.g., polyamory). In this case, the fun of the game is leaning into "bad" polyamory, working against each other and engaging in sabotage rather than collectively coming together to make the dynamic work. During the workshop, one group attempted something along these lines with Monopoly, but I think there are other games that could be a good fit for this project.  

Example A: The "longest road" achievement in Settlers of Catan could be turned into a game where the goal is to build the biggest polycule.  

Example B: I could play with the idea of "Pokémon polyamory" (collecting partners sans queer relationship ethics) through a summoning-and-battling style game in RPG Maker.  

Example C: The Game of Life would is a competitive game about moving up the relationship escalator and hitting expected life milestones as you grow your nuclear family. This could be interesting to tinker with. I am imagining the player moving around the board in little car that gets bigger every time a new person becomes part of your polycule/community; the car would eventually get comedically large and no longer fit on the board (going outside the bounds of "normal" relationships).  

Version 3: Queer competition
A third game in this series could involve engaging with competition in ways that DO align with a queer politics of non-monogamy. How could the rules and structure of competition be changed to make this happen? I have already been exploring how tandem play generates opportunities for queer forms of competition, so maybe there’s a metagaming idea in here somewhere: What happens if we get a group of players to tandem play a single player game of their choice, collectively determine the rules and their goals, and then compete in ways that are actually supporting queer ways of desire and relating that are relevant to each person?  

**Idea 3: Playing With Parts and Wholes**  
What would it look like to make a game about seperate parts coming together to form a unified whole? I'm thinking of media like *Voltron* or *Pacific Rim* where multiple people make up a larger being that needs an alignment of desires, boundaries, and decisions in order to maintain their form and progress through the game. The point would not be to eliminate the differences between characters, but to make choices that help them stick together in spite of those differences.  

I am imagining a *Pacific Rim*-style mech where all the players inside need to find a state of relative equilibruim (or to meet each other in more chaotic states) in order to pilot it effectively. Like a Katamari that rolls itself. I think it would be important that not being aligned doesn't result in a fail state and is instead treated as a new set of conditions that can be adapted to as the players work through conflict. This could represent how being out of alignment is part of all relationsups and is something to work through rather than succeed at avoiding forever. This would also be an interesting way to experiment with alt controllers.  

For reference, here is a link to [some gameplay footage of *Katamari Damacy*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJdER-F_zJo)  

**Idea 4: Playing With Parallels and Mirrored States**  
What would it mean to make a game where movement and positioning are key, but are complicated by the connections between players. Here, I’m thinking about those classic*Zelda* puzzles where you activate a statue that copies or mirrors your movement to solve a puzzle. I would want for a game like this to explore the way that the decisions we make in relationships ripple out to effect other; sometimes we can plan for those effects, and other times they catch us by surprise. What if making a move on one side of the board effected our partners in other parts of the board? Mixing up types of movement could be interesting: Instructions to “move three spaces forward” would be very different from instructions like “move to the nearest tile with a tree on it” for different players on the board.  

For reference, here's a link to [the Sacred Grove Guardian puzzle from *The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SERx6pByLE).  

**Idea 5: Playing With Phantoms and Load-Sharing**  
I was thinking about FromSoftware (Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Elden Ring) and how their online multiplayer system works following a presentation at QGCon. These games are notorious for being difficult and unwelcoming to players. Progress requires us to learn and adapt to each enemy's movements and attacks, often through a trial and error process (where you die a lot). Something that can be really encouraging in these unforgiving worlds is how other players going through this process can show up in your game as ghosts and leave you helpful messages. Walk up to a bloodstain on the ground, and you can see the phantoms and the words they've left behind. If you come across these ghosts and their weird puddles outside a particularly difficult area or a boss fight, they can offer vague hints, words of encouragement, and even silly attempts at sabotage that (although unhelpful for winning) can ease the stress and make you feel less alone. What could it look like to make a game that represents non-monogamy through a distribution of the difficulty of being in the game world across a network?  

I'm imagining a game about pulling off a heist in an outer space setting. In an ideal situation, the whole team can work together on the problem the whole time, but life doesn't work that way: between scheduling differences, different kinds of connections with each other, different goals and desires, and the inevitability of conflict, there are times when the whole team can't be there at the same time, or even times when you find yourself alone. Maybe in these situations, helpful phantoms emerge as members of the team shift between timelines/universes that are layered on top of each other. Some kind of connection that tells the player their network is here to support them, even when they can't all be there physically at once. Maybe despite a physical absence, they can give the player guidance, information, items, levity, etc. that helps them navigate the challenge of solving the problem, even when going "solo."  

The problem could have a variety of solutions depending on who on the team is present/absent at various points of the journey. Maybe your team was scattered across these strange temporal-spatial layers during some world-bending cosmic event and the technology you’re using to bring them into your layer/sustain their existence in “the real world” can only do so for so long/in certain combinations/during specific windows of opportunity. 

**Idea 6: Playing With Vessels and Waters**
I'm thinking about sailing/the sailboat as a metaphor for the relational network (see: *Spiritfarer*). What would it look like to make a game where you start on the militaristic “boat” and then move toward the more equitable and responsive sailing ship?

The warship/ (militaristic, top-down control, clearly defined roles, inflexibility, movement “upward” through merit, insulated from the elements through technological means, set on a determied warpath)

 vs 

The sailboat (distributed power, shifting roles, flexibility, everyone does a little of everything and jumps in when needed, exposed to the elements and using technology to respond to them, navigating open water – response-ability (see: Alexis Shotwell, Donna Haraway))

For reference, here is a link to [some gameplay footage from *Spiritfarer*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7_sn6eXz7U).

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Refining Early Concepts (Continued...)  

*Monday, October 13th, 2025*  
  
During our last meeting, we decided to move forward with the idea of playing with competition. Since this idea entails creating non-monogamy related variations on familiar competitive, this option makes the most sense in terms of project feasibility.  

Since then, I've spent some time creating [an ideation board on Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKRo1kSM=/?share_link_id=854742179856) to show my thinking behind the decision to work with this game or that. 

On this board, I started by sketching out the research context and coming up with a couple questions to frame my thinking:
- Q1: What can using MDM to make an intentionally non-monogamous game tell us about the potential for non-monogamies to catalyze/realize opportunities for queer(er) design and play? 
- Q2: What can we learn about designing for queer(er) play by taking a familiar game system/structure that was designed for a normative mode of play (traditional competition) and re-working it to include non-monogamy? 

I originally narrowed my game selection down to a non-digital option, *The Game of Life*, and a digital option, *Pac-Man*. While working with a classic arcade game would probably be simpler than let's say, *Settlers of Catan*, I think *The Game of Life* is the meatiest option to work with, especially given the way the game has evolved over time. I've used the Miro board as a space to map out the different elements that make up *The Game of Life*, as well as the (significant) differences between the 1860s and 1960s versions. 

Some things that are standing out to me in the moment:
- The differences between 1860s *Life* and 1960s *Life* appear to be mostly formal; the game's messaging about the importance of reaching expected milestones and what it means to be a "good" subject and live a "good" life remains somewhat consistent, it's just updated to suit the time period of that version's production. For example, in more recent versions, players can adopt pets as well as have kids, and both are represented by plastic pegs. 
- The 1860s version uses a *Snakes n' Ladders* style checkered game board where players can move up or down depending on the kinds of spaces they land on. Unlike the track in the 1960s version that shows a clear progression forward through life, this older version uses a clear spatial metaphor of up = good, down = bad, modeling the life/relationship escalator with clear correct steps to reach the top.

## Comparing and Contrasting Life Stories

*Sunday, October 19th, 2025*

I wanted to revisit what I originally wrote when comparing *The Checkered Game of Life* (1860) to *The Game of Life* (1960) (hereafter *CGoL* and *GoL*). After sitting with the materials for a bit, I think I have a better sense of the differences between these designs. I'm hoping that describing these differences will help me identify helpful points of intervention for tinkering. Starting with competition, each point in this list leads into the next, concluding with how each game goes about building a life story for players. 

1. **Competition**  
In both games, players compete to construct the a successful life narrative.  
In both games, players attempt this through movement around the board.  
In both games, refusing to move is not an option. Progress is the rule. 

2. **Movement**   
In *CGoL*, players make active decisions about how they move around the board. 
- These decisions are based on a known outcome (the space where they will land and its effect). 
- The range of possible choices players can make about the direction of movement is determined by chance (the teetotum).
- Movement is incremental (1-2 spaces) and multidirectional (left, right, up, down, and diagonal).
- Players can move fewer spaces at a time with relative flexibility. 
- Players can take different multidirectional and incremental paths in pursuit of the objective.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In *GoL*, players rarely make active decisions about movement along the track.
- The distance of movement (1-10 spaces) is determined by chance (the spinner).
- The direction of movement is mostly determined by the track. 
- The only time players decide the direction is at a fork in the road, which is not a decision based on outcomes (a known space and its effect), but a decision based on risk (the range of spaces where they could land and their potential effects). 
- Players can move a higher number of spaces at a time with less flexibility. 
- Players must follow the same mostly linear path in pursuit of the objective. 

3. **Accumulation**   
In *CGoL*, players construct a successful life narrative by accumulating points. 
- Players collect points by landing on squares that represent positive conditions, traits, or milestones. 
- Points are a numeric representation of players' ability to keep moving and making good choices through life's ups and downs. 
- Players must accumulate a minimum number of points (50) before they can pursue the win condition (landing on the "Happy Old Age" space). 
- Players do not effect one anothers' pathways/ efforts to gather points.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In *GoL*, players construct a successful life narrative by accumulating the most money. 
- Players gain and spend money through a combination of chance-based mechanics (the spinner, landing on spaces) and choice-based mechanics (e.g., optional purchases, Share The Wealth cards). 
- The in-game currency and the bank are representative of real-world money, markets, and financial institutions. All non-monetary assets (e.g., children) are all rendered back into capital at the end. 
- Players must accumulate as much as they can to navigate the risk involved in pursuing the win condition (becoming a Tycoon or being the richest player in Millionaire Acres)
- Players regularly effect one another's efforts to accumulate by capital, both by chance (e.g., required monetary gifts) and by choice (e.g., taking Revenge!, Share the Wealth cards)

4. **Win States**   
In *CGoL*, a player wins when they earn a place on the "Happy Old Age" square by accumulating 100 points and reach it before their opponents.   

In *GoL*, a player wins by having accumulated the most financial capital by the time everyone has reached the end of the track, either by outranking them in a final count or by winning an all-or-nothing bet. 

5. **Life Narratives**   
The story that *CGoL* tells is that you can earn a happy existence if you persevere through life's trials and tribulations, upholding what it means to have moral character in the eyes of God and society.   

The story of *GoL* is a retelling of the myth of meritocracy. You earn a shot at luxury, safety, and security by accumulating as much financial capital as possible through the same rat race everyone else is running. As long as you keep participating in the market as a good capitalist subject who is willing to act at the expense of others to win, you can not only succeed, but be the *most* successful.   

In both of these games, the storyline of one's life has an aspirational trajectory: You start from the bottom and earn your spot in The Good Place, whether that place is *CGoL*'s happy old age or *GoL*'s fancy retirement in a gated community reserved for the ultra-wealthy. 

\
**Describing/Reflecting VS Prescribing/Reacting**   
One of the major differenes at work here is in how players make the journey from their respective bottoms to their respective tops. So, let's come back to movement. The numbered list above shows how the relationship between chance/movement/decision-making shapes the life story of each game. The narratives this relationship produces is always some combination of descriptive and prescriptive.    

That said, I think I want to argue that *CGoL* is more descriptive/reflective while *GoL* is more prescriptive/reactive. 

**CGoL: Descriptive/Reflective?**    
Of course, *CGoL* involves some level of prescriptive logic: The rules say players must accumulate a specific amount of Good-Hard-Working-Person points to earn their rightful place on the Happy Old Age space. This expectation of what to do/what it means to be good is clearly defined and enforced via the rules.   

The thing is, the cadence of movement itself leans into mode of play that invites description. Every time players spin the teetoum and make a decision about what direction to move in and how far, they are agentically constructing a path from a *known* Point A to a *known* Point B. Players have to hop around the board to progress, and the process of deciding how to hop around the board generates a micro, descriptive account of *what did happen* to accompany the game's macro prescriptive account of *what should happen.*   

As a result, the game may invite players to regularly reflect on their choices both in terms of how they affect the chance of winning/losing, in terms of their real-world decisions, and in terms of how they feel about the overall life story that's emerging.    

Example: *All players are trying to accumulate points to reach the Happy Old Age space. Player 1 doesn't make it far from Infancy before landing on Ambition and being sent downward to Fame (a supposedly shameful place). Player 1 strategizes about their new position on the board and how they might use different rolls to leave Fame behind in pursuit of more points. On their next turn, Player 1 lands on Bravery and is sent to Honor. Player 1 reflects on how trying to become famous requires its own form of bravery (opposing the game's prescriptive logic)/a time when someone they knew brought dishonour on themselves by trying and failing to become famous (aligning with the game's prescriptive logic). Player 2 lands on the Matrimony space and Player 1 thinks about how their friends got married before they did, wondering when they will find someone. On their next turn, Player 1 decides whether trying to land on Matrimony is worth it on their way to Happy Old Age (it isn't worth any points, after all)...*   

Each turn of spinning/deciding/moving involves active choices that invite players to reflect on the social, ethical, and philosophical minutae of the life story they are constructing in the game, and potentially their own life story outside the game. This process generates an descriptive account of who you are, whether you are a good person, what you offer to society, and ultimately what you've earned and deserve in the end. 

**GoL: Prescriptive/Reactive?**   
*GoL* does offer some opportunity for players to construct a descriptive account of their life's trajectory: One player may decide to go into business while another chooses college; One player might choose to buy new clothes while another prioritizes marriage and saves up for a diamond ring. Players can absolutely reflect on these choices, what they mean for their progress in the game, and how they relate their real-world values (or not).   

The thing is, these choices are 1. rare and 2. locked between fixed points: Forks in the road like the Business and College routes are rare and ultimately lead to the same places; Getting married and having children are a requirement if you want to progress down the track. Unlike in *CGoL*, everyone functionally travels down the same path. Even if you circle back to a familiar stretch of road, the only way fowrard is forward and all roads lead to the same destination.   

Players can't reflect on the choice they made to get from a known Point A to known Point B because they do not choose where they go. Instead, movement through various life events on the board happens *to* players as a matter of chance, and decision-making is about reacting to those chance-based effects through the control they do have over various money mechanics (earning/borrowing/betting/stealing/spending).   

Example: *All players are trying to accumulate money and win the game by having the most money at the end. Player 1 spins an 8, lands on the "Pay $5000 For Toupe" space, and must pay this amount to the bank. Player 2 spins a 7 and lands not far behind on the "Sell Cattle Ranch: Collect $150,000" space. Where each of them goes next is a matter of chance, not strategy, and so Player 1's next move is about maximizing their own gains and diminishing Player 2's. First, Player One gives Player 2 a Share the Wealth card that forces them to give up hald their earnings on the cattle ranch. Since Player 1 crossed the toll bridge first, Player 2 also pays them a fee. Players 1 and 2 reflect on how this exchange has affected their standing in the rat race, both in terms of their finances, and in terms of their physical position in relation to the Millionaire Acres.*   

In this case, the different chapters of a life story aren't being related back to social/ethical/philisophical ideas of what it means to be a good person; instead, every chapter affirms that success goes hand in hand with enough/the right kind of participation in the market: cutthroat competition!   

\
**Concluding Thoughts**   
*CGoL* explores *how* people live good lives by asking players to make decisions about movement, emphasizing the different contours of each players' journey to their respective old ages. *GoL* de-emphasizes the differences between each players' journey, instead focusing on how they mitigate the effects of the same systemic forces in an effort to end up with the most resources.

## From Conflict to Competition   

*Tuesday, October 21st, 2025*   

**Working definition of competition:**   
Beings, groups, or non-human forces working against each other to produce connected but opposing (or even incompatible) outcomes, sometimes as part of a game. 

I wanted to get a more concrete sense of what makes something a competition rather than a conflict. I started by listing common forms of narrative conflict found in literature: Character vs. Self, Character vs. Character, Character vs. Society, Character vs. Nature, Character vs. Technology, Character vs. Supernatural, etc...   

In a game, these are less examples of competition and more examples of just... struggling against something. Here are my thoughts on what they would need to be a competition proper:
- The being/force/system being struggled against is affecting the game by making decisions in effort to reach an objective (it wins) that opposes the player's own objective (you win).
- It feels easier to call this kind of struggle a competition if the pathways toward these opposing objectives run parallel in some way; this might be out of a desire for fairness related to an attachment to the idea of "competitive spirit", BUT
- Competition is not always about fairness; This is an hypothetical ideal and not reality of competition  (See: economic competition, biological competition; what these all seem to have in common is that there is a process has some kind of mutually exclusive outcome)
- The opposing objectives and the respective pathways required to reach them do not have to be fair, but they can be.
- There does not have to be a reward for winning, but there can be.   

<p align="center">Based on this, competition is: a game/process where oppositional forces influence play by making decisions in an effort to produce mutually exclusive outcomes, often to receive a reward.</p>

So, one thing distinguishing a struggle from a competition is the role of decision-making. 
1. Decisions can be made by other players OR by a non-human entity that makes choices (i.e., AI)
2. Player(s) vs Society/Nature/Technology/Supernatural are examples of struggle because these are forces that can be represented by rules, but can't make active decisions during the game that modulate play in service or this goal or that goal 
3. Competing against these forces (as opposed to struggling against them) requires giving them a decision-making representative

Making a multiplayer game is a simple way to give forces like Society/Nature/Technology/Supernatural a competitive presence in the game via a decision-making representative. In a multi-player game, the rules can assign a player or group of players to make these choices. 

A note on single-player competitions: Are they even possible? The player can't compete against themselves because there can be no mutually exclusive outcome: the player wins, or the player wins. What could a single-player game featuring competition look like?

1) Competition could be a feature of the game's story rather than its rules (e.g., a role-playing game about a basketball game, about romantic competition/courtship).   
This option feels uninteresting.
2) The player could compete against a non-human, choice-making entity (i.e., an AI).   
This option is workable.
3) The player could be a judge, a prize, or the arbiter of the competition's rules rather than a competitor (e.g., by making the competitors NPCs, something dating simulation games kind of do already).   
This option is workable and more interesting than option two.
3) The player could compete as a representative for all sides with a truly a equal investment in all outcomes, effectively reintroducing a level of mutual exclusivity (e.g., Player can win as X OR win as Y OR win as X+Y while winning as Z is off the table).   
This option feels an overly complicated way of exploring that classic "Can you really play chess against yourself?" question.

&nbsp;
The Game Plan:
- The simplest path forward for now is to make a multiplayer game.  
- I can use the experience of making a multi-player game to reflect on my dissertation's focus on single-player experiences. 
- If making a single-player game makes sense down the line, I can experiment with the player not being a competitor, but a prize/judge/arbiter of the competition's rules for NPCs.

## It's Biology, Baby

*Tuesday, October 21st, 2025* 

In my last journal entry, I mentioned that while fairness and equality are often expected as part of the spirit of competition, they're not required.   

The two examples I gave were economic competition and biological competition. *CGoL* and *GoL* are about moral/micro-economic competition, but let's take a look at different kinds of biological competition and see if they connect with my analyses of these games so far. 

Here's a screenshot of a graphic developed by Natasha Gownaris of Gettysburg College's environmental studies department:

![Biology competition mechamisms - Gettysburg College](<Images - Ideation/Mechanisms of competition in biology - Ecology for All - Gettysburg College.png>)

You can check out the details of the full lesson [here](https://bio.libretexts.org/Courses/Gettysburg_College/01%3A_Ecology_for_All/15%3A_Competition/15.01%3A_Introduction_and_Types_of_Competition).

Sp = Species
P = Predator
R = Resource
*Exploitation efficiency: The efficiency of a transfer of energy upward; How well something consumes something else*.

**1. Interference or Contest Competition (Direct)**
- An individual or population behaves in a way that directly reduces another individual or population's exploitation efficiency
- Game equivalent: Player 1 takes action that directly reduces Player 2's efficient exploitation of a resource
- In *GoL*, Player 1 takes Revenge! on/gives a Share the Wealth card to Player 2; Player 2's efficient exploitation of financial assets has been directly reduced. 
- Note: No such interference competiton happens in *CGoL*. 

**2. Exploitation or Scramble Competition (Indirect)**
- Individuals or populations use a shared resource in a way that results in mutual depression; indirect competition via a shared resource
- Game equivalent: Player 1 uses a shared but limited resource, indirectly impacting Player 2 when they use that same resource and vice versa
- Note: No such scramble competition in either *CGoL* or *GoL*. In *GoL*, money is a shared resource via the bank but there is no real scarcity; Players compete to see who can gain the most and losses are caused either by luck/chance, or by other players.

**3. Apparent Competition**
- Two unrelated prey species that are in indirect competition via a shared predator.
- Player 1 and Player 2 compete indirectly to survive through third-party actions (e.g., a third player, the dungeon master, etc.)
- In *GoL*, the only identifiable mutually shared predator for all players is luck/chance. The bank is more of a structural/institutional support for wealth accumulation than a predator in this context. 
- Note: If there is apparent competition in either of these games, luck is the shared predator driving competition; Players win by successfully mitigating the risks of the game's chance based mechanics. This also means that apparent competition is mostly a feature of *GoL*, since *CGoL*'s movement involves less chance and more decision-making. 

\
**Food for Thought Going Forward:**   
*GoL* primarily emphasizes interference competition (competing players directly impact each other), with a touch of apparent competition (competing players are affected by a mutual predator). Neither games uses scramble competition, where competing players are affected by the availability of a mutually shared resource. What might a version of the game that uses scramble competition look like?
- Players would start with a shared and limited resource
- The availability/scarcity of that resource affects all competitors
- Changes in the availability/scarcity of that resource would likely need to be left up to chance: player actions impacting the resource directly would be interferene competition, and the state of the resource being determined by the bank (a predator) would just be apparent competition
- The state of this pool of resources could change regularly (e.g., at the end of every turn), but in a way that is not directly connected to the player's actions
- Example: Player 1 moves 5 spaces and spends X dollars on Y item; At the end of Player 1's turn, the condition of the pool of shared resourced is altered (e.g., a card is drawn - there is a recession and money is removed from the pot); Player 2 takes their turn under this new set of conditions...

# Building Blocks

## Spacing Out

*October 25, 2025*

I took some time this week to take stock of the variety of (different kinds of spaces in *GoL*), in part to help me identify all the spaces that have something to do with intimacies (in this case, spousal and family relationships). 

 Note: When I use the term "initmacies," I'm taking cues from Nathan Rambukkana's research on non-monogamies and using Lauren Berlant's definition that is inclusive of sex, romance, friendship, kinship, and other forms of connection that "*impact* on people and on which they depend for living" (1997, p. 284, as cited in Rambukkana, 2015, p. 27). 

Here's a breakdown of spaces that refer to the intimate:

1. Financial penalties (general)   
- “HELP POOR RELATIONS! PAY $1000”
- “FATHER-IN-LAW NEEDS MONEY! PAY $10,000”
- “ECCENTRIC AUNT LEAVES $500 CATS. PAY $10,000 TO GIVE THEM AWAY”<sup>1</sup>
- “UNCLE LEFT YOU SKUNK FARM! PAY $8,000 TO GET RID OF IT!”
- “UNCLE IN JAIL. PAY $500 BAIL”   

2. Financial rewards (general)   
- “ADD BABY SON! COLLECT PRESENTS” X2
- ADD TWIN SONS! COLLECT PRESENTS”
- “ADD A BABY DAUGHTER! COLLECT PRESENTS” X4
- “ADOPT A BOY AND A GIRL! COLLECT PRESENTS.”

3. Purchases (no in-game item)
- "MEET FUTURE SPOUSE! PAY $500 FOR DIAMOND RING”<sup>2</sup>

4. Required spaces (required effect)
- “IF CHILDLESS GIVE $50,000 TO ORPHANAGE!”<sup>3</sup>


<sup>1</sup> Subtext: Don’t end up alone, childless, and a burden on your relatives like this "cat lady" stereotype. 
<sup>2</sup> This space is a way of maximizing earnings early by taking a particular life path. Going into business = not distracted by school; Business is aligned with marriage and procreation while school is aligned with childless philosophizing.
<sup>3</sup> Not having children is financially penalized (even though in this game, not having them would be entirely by luck!) Social subtext: If you don’t procreate, you had better repay your debt to society by helping out non-biological children. The game punishes you for failing to do your duty. 
<sup>6</sup> Getting married is double financially invcentivized: there is an initial monetary gift at the expense of your competitors, and it opens the door to having children, who are also worth money at the end of the game.

**Contradictory Logics in *GoL*: Capitalism Versus Hetero-Monogamy**   
In *CGoL*, the Matrimony space has physical proximity to end point (the Happy Old Age space) but there are no points awarded for landing on it. *GoL*, on the other hand, uses marriage as a step toward the accumulation of wealth. 

Marriage:
- Is required. Players must stop on this space to progress. 
- Is financially incentivized. On their wedding day, players recieve a monetary gift at their competitor's expense. 
- Is an investment. Marriage allows you to have children and children are worth money. 
- Costs nothing (or very little). The only way your spouse ever has a financial cost is if you spin a 3 on your first turn.
- Is monogamous. There is a rule in the game reflecting real-world laws banning bigamy. 

Capitalist/Mechanical Logic says: Make as much money as possible!
Rationale: Get married because marriage = kids = $

BUT

Hetero-Monogamous/Social Logic: Be monogamous!
Rationale: Only get married once because non-monogamy is illegal and morally wrong.

There's a contradiction here. Based on the game's own logics, one strategy to be a good worker-subject would be to have as many partners as possible and, by extension, as many children as possible! They're worth $20,000 each during the end-stage of the game and cost nothing, so they really do seem to offer quite the uhm... bang for your buck. This game's social logic tells us that being married to multiple spouses is bad and wrong - what happens if we tinker with that?

## Prototype One: *Matri-Money*  

*October 26, 2025*

I spent a good deal of this week learning how to make a simple game board in Gadot. Progress is slow. I'm not an experienced programmer - so much of my creative practice has been about seeing what can be done with basic and approachable tools - and even this engine reccommends taking some computer science courses. May my audacity carry me forward.

While getting familiar with Gadot basics (and continuing to consider paper prototyping options - see my questions at the end of this journal entry) I decided to start prototyping using software I already feel comfortable with to get some momentum. Using Twine, I made a game board with a virtual spinner numbered 1-10. Key variables being tracked are spouses and cash. 

The idea: Leaning into a contradition between *GoL*'s economic and social logics, this game has players compete to marry as many people as they can on their morning commute. The goal is to accumulating spouses and, by extension, $children$. The first one to the finish line/the office gets a "baby bonus." The player with the most children, and therefore the most money, wins. 

I started with a simple mock-up board that is about a quarter of *GoL*'s size (40 spaces not including the starting and finishing spaces). I athen used Twine's Harlowe language to create a series of virtual spinners. I wanted a singular spinner but the variable tracking got cumbersome and I really wanted to ride this wave.

Here's a screen shot of the full Twine project so far: 

![Twine screenshot - Matri-Money_V1](<Process/Images/Images - Prototpye Screenshots/MatriMoney_V1_screenshot.png>)

Twisty, twisty little passages. 

Considerations for Future Changes:
- Something about the fact that players can't see the full board (only the spaces they land on via text passage) changes the feel of competition. I think that translating this into a version where people play Battleship style (unable to see where their opponent is or their progress) could introduce an element of communication/trust/boundary work, (potentially adding an injection of relational significant otherness to go with the game's "bad polyamory.")
- In this version, you pass by marriage spaces you don't land on. What would change in a version where you have to stop on all marriage spaces you pass?
- For playtesting: 10 numbers on the spinner might be too much for a board game this small. Things may move too fast, but who knows how speed will factor into this experience. See how it goes and consider reducing it to 5. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Layers of Journals...

*October 28, 2025*

I decided to create a secondary journal for when I'm actively working on the project. I think this is helpful for not feeling like I need to edit my thoughts as much. I felt a bit like I needed to curate what makes it into this larger project journal more selectively. This way, I have a space to jot down more granular thoughts and ideas down as they come up. 

The categories/headings are intended to make it easier to parse through my thinking at the end of this project: I have sections for what I want to do, what I did, what I plan to do in the next session, ideas down the line, and then reflections on the whole enchilada.

## Thoughts on Using Twine

*October 29, 2025*

During today's analysis meeting for the Materializing Design group, the discussion briefly pivoted into the affordances and limitations of game-making tools (specifically software, engines) that keep code hidden in a user-friendly game-making interface. This includes tools like GB Studio, RPG Maker, etc...

This got me thinking about what it means that I chose to start this process using Twine. 

**Limitations**
1. Observation: Sara Ahmed wrote that "the more a path is followed, the more a path is followed" (CITATION). Twine was the tool I used to make my fisrt ever game and I've been returning to it on-and-off in some capacity for years. Sometimes it does feel like the more I choose to use it, the more I will continue to choose to use it and, in doing so, the more I may actually be closing off opportunities to learn new tools and approaches. This is why I've been trying to teach myself to use Godot at the same time. 
2. Practice: If I'm going to continue making games as someone who is not a professional programmer and relying on these tools that "hide" code, I very much need to make sure I am using a variety and actively thinking about how each shapes my approach, over time and in relation to one another. 

**Affordances**
- Using a familiar tool meant I could make something *quickly.* I had an idea and was able to create a functional core game-loop over the course of a few days. 
- Making a "board game" using a tool that is largely designed for creating hypertext fiction led to some interesting new possibilities. I'm specifically thinking about how playing this game requires each person to open up the same digital board on their own device and communicate verbally to take turns. What if part of the game required players to share specific information and gave them the option of misrepresenting their situation? (E.g., "No, I'm not married to Person X")

&nbsp;

## An Unplanned Playtest

*November 1st, 2025*

I swung by the lab and played a quick round of *Matri-Money* (V1c) with a couple of friends and colleagues. 

A few observations from this unexpected playtest: 
- The people who volunteered to play the game chose to play as a team of two. When they got married, they referred to the spouse as "our wife"
- The players started narrating our life stories as we passed over specific spaces. For example, when I passed over a space telling me I needed to buy a wedding present for a colleague, one of them said that it must have been for their recent wedding. 
- There's a bug affecting at least one of the annulment spaces 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## On Traceability and Tidying Up 

*November 11th-12th, 2025*

Journal, it has been too long! 

I've been away from *Matri-Money* for longer than I'd like. Something, something, unexpected business. I also got on a flight to British Columbia. I'm writing this from up North in Prince George. It's a small city. Public transit can get you where you need to go, but it can take a while. It's definitely a place marked by car culture. Many, many vehicles making the world go round. White pick-up trucks are very popular. 

In some ways, Prince George feels like a fitting location for putting the finishing touches on this game.

I wonder what Matri-Money look like if you could use public transit... Adding this to the list of variations.

I'm also adding the idea of "mergers" - see the game-specific journal entry on this date for more detail. 


--

I've clicked through the current build a few times and it's clear that a 10-space spinner is far too much movement at once for what is essentially a miniature board, at least compared to the original board for *GoL*. I managed to reach the end of the game with no spouses in just a few turns. Getting to the end without any spouses is fine, but that is a quick commute! I want it to feel more like a journey and less like your life flashing before your eyes. I've reduced the maximum number on the spinners to 5 (and am going to add some spaces that send players backwards).

When I went to go make this change, I thought to myself "I'm going to need to edit every single spinner and delete specific chunks of code from 40+ Twine passages." Then I realized - no I don't. All I need to do is change the $d10 variable (to random number between 1 and 5 rather than 1 and 10). Easy peasy. Doing this will make the game work how I wanted it to work. Removing the connections between the passages is actually just about "tidying up" the code so there is no trace of the previous design choice I made. 

I'm the kind of person who likes to keep things looking tidy, sometimes to the point of getting in my own way. I think that using a tool like Twine that visually represents the connections between different bits of code using squares and arrows not only makes me think about keeping things neat and tidy, but creates points of contact with the build where I can easily exercise that impulse. 

By resisting the urge to tidy up, I leave behind traces of my choices in the design, keep code that will be useful for if I end up making a larger board where 10 spaces is a more suitable amount of movement per turn, and free up time and energy to work on other parts of the game (e.g., working on the "life story" these spaces are expressing).

## Matri-Money: Wrapping Up

*November 14th-18th, 2025*

### The Playtest
I invited my partner (T) to play the game (*MatriMoney* V1d) and share his thoughts. It might be worth noting that we've been together for over ten years and that we've always been non-monogamous. I've spoken to him about this game concept before, so he has a general idea of my intentions, but he's also not someone who plays games often. 

Toward the end of the game, we were neck in neck. Reducing the spinner from 10 to 5 and adding spaces that force players to lose spouses or go backwards both made a huge difference. I didn't expect to make something that I would actually have fun playing. The final score was 238 to 255 in my favour.  

The thing that jumped out to me the most during this playtest was how the game ended. Because we are playing seperate instances of the game on different devices, there is no way for one player's Twine code to know that the other player has reached the office. So, while the winning player's score is calculated automatically in-browser, the losing player (or players) can only know their final score by doing the math themselves. 

I find this kind of funny. It's as though losing the race adds insult to injury by asking you to manually count your chickens, a.k.a. going through your personal finances. That said, it's entirely possible to do the math and come out ahead of the person who reached the office first; The winner of the race component of the game may actually regret having reached the office too soon, thereby losing out on opportunities to continue collecting spouses. The game ends up expressing that being too eager to get to work isn't desirable or something to be *too* enthusiastic about. It places emphasis on the idea that getting married and having kids is the most desirable/efficient way to make money. 

According to T: 
- The game feels very "*Monopoly*-like"
- There was some confusion about whether each turn was a morning commute or the whole game was a morning commute
- I should add something making it clear about how you are connecting with new spouses from inside the car (e.g., waving to fellow drivers)
- It was unclear that players are supposed to take turns or how turn-taking should work

Post Playtest Changes (*MatriMoney* V1e): 
- Intro text edited for clarity (making it clear that the whole game takes place on one morning commute, that you spend the whole game driving, that the game ends whenever someone reaches the office, and that some players will need to do math when all is said and done)
- Removed some unnecessary/reduntant text (e.g., deleting "You spun the spinner" and just saying what the spinner landed on)

I wanted to make negative $Cash values red BUT I NEED TO MOVE ON. 

&nbsp;
## New Directions

*December 3rd, 2025*

For the last chunk of time, I've been working on two things. 

1) Creating a non-digital version of the Twine build of *MatriMoney*
2) Working on a fantasy RPG version of *MatriMoney* in Bitsy. 

My first thought is about how this journal almost ceased to exist in my brain as soon as I started working with physical materials. 

I think part of this is because my tendency to get sucked into a task in a way that feels more like hyperfixation than just flow. Combined with poor interoception, it's a deadly combo: my body doesn't always send me signals that say "you've been doing this for a long time and should probably move, switch tasks, take a break, etc.". Without those cues, there isn't a natural inclination to transition from working with  craft supplies to journaling digitally. 

Ideas for what to do about this going foward:
1. I could try taking notes by hand when I'm working with physical materials and just typing them out? I find that I retain information better with hand-written notes, but honestly, the idea of having to type everything out a second time feels... annoying? 
2. I could take pictures of those notes and keep a seperate "photo journal" for when I'm working with non-digital materials. The problem I have with this is how it makes me feel spread "too thin" across different workspaces. I already have a second journal that I was specifically using when I was actively working on the Twine build, and even that made my work feel "like butter scraped over too much bread" (to quote Bilbo Baggins in *The Fellowship of the Ring*) 
3. I outsource the job of sending these signals from my body to my phone and set an alarm that tells me to take a journalling break. 

Option one involves unnecessary extra steps and option two involves unnecessary extra workspaces. Option three is the simplest splution, so I think I'll start there. 

### MatriMoney: Bitsy Edition
When I haven't been fussing about trying to figure out all the right pieces for a non-digital version of *MatriMoney*, I've been working on something in Bitsy. 

As I worked in Twine, I kept getting the feeling 1860s *Checkered Game of Life* wasn't getting nearly as much attention as the 1960s *GoL*. Something about the simplicity of that version sticks with me, especially when it comes to how the game used a point system that didn't involve money. It wasn't (just) about accumulating capital, it was about making choices that aligned with the game's idea of a morally "good" person. *CGoL* still very much implies that being a good person involves making decisions that lead to a good paying job (otherwise, how could reach a comfortable retirement?), so I don't need to do away with that thread entirely, but I did want to create something that places more emphasis on the moral angle. 

 I decided to do this by using the trappings of fantasy RPGs, speficially, the original *Legend of Zelda* (1986).I borrowed a handful of game elements to start with (figures, scripts, even color palettes) and then did some brainstorming about how to re-configure this classic story to tell players something about the supposed moral imperative to marry and reproduce!

 My decision to use Bitsy was mostly based on a gut feeling. The aesthetic qualities of this platform/tool (simple pixel art, animations, and colour schemes) felt right. Because the Twine version removed the visual representation of moving through space, I was interested in bringing that back without necessarily having to come back the board game formula. 

 So far, the concept is... loose. I have the player taking on the role of a fantasy hero. Much like Link, they enter a cave and talk to a Wizard. In this case, the Wizard (named Milton Bradley) instructs the player that in order to follow the path of a hero, they must "go forth and multiply" by using the Wedding Ring to save the realm. When they pick up the ring, text appears on screen that says "It's dangerous to be alone! Take this!" The core idea so far is to have players charge up the Wedding Ring so they can marry as many Princesses as possible. 

 From there, I've just been playing (improvising?) with Bitsy's affordances to figure out what comes next. Moving in this direction takes me further away from my intiial goal of exploring what a *competitive* game about non-monogamy could look like; I'll be keeping this in mind as I move forward.
 
 While following these instincts, I'm hitting road blocks. 
 
 For example, I haven't actually figured out *how to make it dangerous to be alone in this world.* Bitsy sprites can't *move* like *Zelda* enemies do. I created an enemy-type sprite called "The Spouseless" (a sad and angry looking blob with a mouth), but quickly realized I can't make it move around the forest so players can dodge or attack it. You can change a sprite's location in a room by using something called the room-swapping technique (essentially transporting the avatar into an identical room where the sprite has been moved), but that isn't really what I'm looking for... These sprites seem to be intended for choice-based interactions involving dialogue and items - not movement based interactions. (I did find [a dungeon crawler made in Bitsy](https://breadmouth.itch.io/a-bitsy-dungeon-crawler), but there were no moving enemies!) 

So, if the challenge of charging the Wedding Ring isn't dodging dangerous (unmarried, childless) creatures in the woods, how are players going to progress? 

**Ideas Going Forward**
- Currently, I have the player charging the Wedding Ring using a shrine (very *Zelda* indeed). Maybe I can create a mechanic for accessing these shrines that calls back to *CGoL*. What if the player had to answer morality-based questions correctly to use the shrine, proving they are a particular kind of "good" person to progress? 
- Like I mentioned earlier in this entry, *CGoL* doesn't involve any direct wealth accumulation, but it does imply that being a good person involves getting a good (persumably well-paying) job in order to reach a comfortable retirement. Maybe the right move is to make money a resource without making it the goal/win-state. Players collect money to charge the Wedding Ring, which enables them to collect spouses/children
- By emphasizing Family Legacy over wealth accumulation, I can continue to lean into the logic of "more spouses = more babies = success," in this case because my spouses are ensuring there are more heroes who will continue to "save the realm" (by getting married and having children of their own...)
- It might make more sense for the people you propose to to be fellow adventurers rather than Princesses. We'll see what happens

**Reflections on My Process**
- I don't think I'm going to continue keeping a seperate journal for when I'm actively working on a game build. It makes my brain feel unnecessarily and unpleasantly busy and makes my thinking feel disorganized. I think there's a difference between choosing to document something outside the journal because it makes sense in the moment and insisting on a seperation between thinking/reflecting during active creative work and thinking/reflecting after the fact. It hasn't felt like a very useful distinction 
- I'm hoping that switching out of Twine and into a tool for building visual environments might help me gain a better sense of what I would do with it next. 

&nbsp;
## Finding New Bitsy-s and Pieces to Play With

Okay - no charging shrines. Let's just see what happens if we decide that the Wedding Ring is powered by money. Since this is a fantasy adventure, let's go with gold coins. How does the player earn those coins? To work that out, I went back to *CGoL*'s game board. 

**CGoL Spaces and Moral Rhetoric**
Note: Happy Old Age Space = Win State/End Goal; Matrimony Space = turned into a mechanic

Positive Spaces
1. Honour (-> Bravery)
2. Happiness (-> Honesty) 
3. College (-> School)
4. Success (-> Perseverance)
5. Fat Office (-> Influence)
6. Congress (-> Politics)
7. Wealth (-> Industry, Government Contract)

Negative Spaces
1. Fame (-> Ambition)
2. Disgrace (-> Idleness)
3. Prison (->Crime)
4. Poverty (-> Impertinence)
5. Ruin (-> Gambling)

**From A Checkered Game of Life to the Tale of a Fantasy Hero**
The player will gain gold coins (thereby charging the Wedding Ring and proposing to princesses) by doing some combination of: 

1. Being brave, which is honourable.  
This aligns pretty well with a fantasy hero.  

2. Bring honest, which makes you happy.  
Honesty is also a trait that feels pretty typical for a fantasy hero.  

3. Being educated, which leads to further education.  
You don't usually see fantasy heroes going to school. That said, if I were to interpret this as the player needing to learn something specific about the world (and maybe pass a short quiz about it), this could work.  

4. Persevering, which brings success.
Succeeding through perseverence also aligns with the usual progression of a fantasy hero.  

5. Being influential, which results in a position of power.
See #4: Using influence to gain power reads to me like what the player is doing when they control the fantasy hero into succeeding through perseverence. 
   
6. Engaging with politics, which leads to government involvement.  
I guess I can decide how much I want to engage with the idea that the Princesses being proposed to are part of a monarchy. 

7. Working in government or industry, which leads to wealth.
See #6; Also, working in alignment with the kingdom's goals of having more adventurers to save them in the future (more workers for the workforce) earns you money. 

8. Not being too ambitious, which leads to fame (shameful).
This one is tricky. I could combine it with #12 (gambling, ruin) by inviting the player to take risks with their money, losing, and earning themselves a shameful reputation (infamy?). 

9. Not being lazy because it leads to to disgrace.
Refusing to do what the game is asking means not progressing, easy as that. 

10. Not committing crimes because it leads to prison.
Not being a criminal also feels fairly easy to align with being a fantasy hero. Steal the item? Lose money. Return it to its rightful owner? More gold to charge the Wedding Ring. 

11. Not being impertinent because it leads to poverty.
Fantasy heroes are supposed to be kind and honourable, so it would make sense that rudeness would cause the player to lose money. 

12. Not gambling, because it leads to ruin. 
See #8. 


**Implementing These as Scenes in Bitsy: Five Scenarios**
Note: (4+5+9) These things (perseverence, influence, power, not being lazy, success) are arguably often implied in the video game fantasy hero's journey (unless the game in question is actively trying to subvert those traits).

1. (1) An situation where the player saves someone/something from a scary situation. For their bravery, they are are rewarded in gold. 
Q: Does the situation actually need to be scary for the player, or is it enough for the player to recognize the choice as "an act of bravery" on the part of the hero?  

2. (2+10) A situation where the player comes across a stolen object. They are given the choice to keep the object (lie, commmit a crime) or return it to its rightful owner (be honest, stay out of trouble). The player would be rewarded in gold for choosing the former (which would make the hero happy).  

3. (3+8+12) A situation where the player must gather information (e.g., facts written on notes left scattered around asking, for example, what the Princess's favourite dessert is) and demonstrate their knowledge in order to earn gold. I'm thinking they could meet an NPC who is laying a quiz game. This is combined with #8 (Ambition/Shame) and #12 (gambling/ruin) because the player risks losing gold if they answer incorrectly.  

4. (6+7) Making progress in this game could involve getting closer to the monarchy. Maybe you start off proposing to non-Royals and "earn" the right to propose to the Princess as a sort of final boss? Helping save the kingdom by marrying and reproducing (creating more adventurers to help save the kindgdom in the future) does indicate that our hero is politically engaged on some level.  

5. (11) A situation where the player can earn gold by avoiding being rude to someone. Being kind and polite gets them closer to gaining another spouse.  

--

This gives me a total of five potential gold-earning/Ring charging scenarios for players. Now I just need to figure out which one to start with. #2, the quest to return a stolen object seems like a fairly simple and workable idea. Will update. 

-- 

Last task: adjusting the if/else condition on the first chest so that it only increases the Wedding Ring's charge by 1; at the moment, it's still increasing even after the chest has been emptied! After that I want to make the transition into the next room a one-way exit into the adventure zome... maybe I can try to make one simple room for each of the scenarios listed above?
